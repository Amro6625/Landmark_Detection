# Landmark_Detection



## Introduction:

Embarking on an exploration of the dynamic intersection between artificial intelligence (AI) and the travel industry, my research delves into the transformative impact of deep learning technologies on image classification within the travel and tourism sector. With a burgeoning global contribution of over $5.8 billion to the GDP (Statista, 2021), this study gravitates toward landmark recognition as a central theme, aiming to craft a robust model that seamlessly identifies landmarks in diverse conditions. This endeavor aligns with the broader initiative to enhance the travel experience through automated landmark identification, as discussed in the impactful work by Bulchand-Gidumal (2022).



## Objective:

My research centers on the pivotal question of how an AI-driven system can enrich the travel experience by effectively recognizing various landmarks. The primary goal is to construct an advanced system functioning as an automated tour guide. This system, upon analyzing user-captured images, not only identifies landmarks but also provides historical and cultural insights, creating an immersive journey.



## Methodology:

The research methodology entails compiling a comprehensive image dataset through targeted Google searches, meticulously organizing it, and conducting thorough data cleaning. TensorFlow emerges as a key ally in managing data, preprocessing, and model training. A baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is established, paving the way for subsequent deep learning approaches, with custom CNNs and transfer learning models like VGG16, ResNet 50, MobileNet, and EfficientNet. The project employs rigorous training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation through Confusion Matrices and Classification Reports.



## Results:

The initial SVM model showcases a modest 71% accuracy, setting the stage for more sophisticated models. The custom CNN achieves an impressive 95% accuracy, with transfer learning models (ResNet, EfficientNet, VGG16) outperforming, reaching accuracy rates exceeding 98%. Notably, the ResNet model exhibits a remarkable 99.52% accuracy, showcasing its prowess in landmark recognition.



## Conclusion and Future Work:

In conclusion, the study demonstrates the efficacy of deep learning, especially ResNet and EfficientNet, in landmark recognition for the travel industry. Future work could involve training on larger datasets, testing on a wider range of landmarks, and integrating the system into a mobile application. The study lays the groundwork for leveraging AI to enhance the travel experience, with the potential for further optimization and advancements in the field.
